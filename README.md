# Learn-Vim

This is vim tutor for zoomers.
It was made as an extension for vscode.

I stole it and made it a git repo to go wild practicing and git restore the damage done (on neovim of course, who would use microsoft software in 2022?).

Shamelessly stolen from : https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/blog/learn-vim-a-new-extension-to-help-you-learn-vim-in-vscode
